Why?

Any organization of members should embrace the notion of democracy where each member has equal power if it is to thrive through the will of its members.

This can be implemented through :term:`Direct Democracy` [#DDProb]_ where each member gets to vote on every issue. However, not all members are interested in all issues and :term:`Direct Democracy` cannot scale because it quickly becomes impossible for all members to vote meaningfully on all issues.

For this reason, most organisations (and governments) use :term:`Representative Democracy` with the aim of approximating :term:`Direct Democracy`. While :term:`Representative Democracy` scales well, there is ample documentation and evidence that it fails to adequately represent members' interests and is prone to corruption and exploitation.

Enter :term:`Liquid Democracy`, where members can vote directly or delegate and reclaim their voting power as they see fit. :term:`Liquid Democracy` is enabled by technology and may vary between :term:`Direct Democracy` (where every member is concerned with and votes on every issue) and :term:`Representative Democracy` where almost all members delegate their votes on all issues to a small number of "committee members" or "members of parliament" for substantial periods of time.

However, :term:`Liquid Democracy` is complex and may be difficult for members to understand and work with. It may also 'spam' members with information to the point that they fail to identify information that is relevant to them.

:term:`Monsuite` addresses this by providing a system that scales from a predefined Direct Democracy or Representative Democracy initial state with a gradual learning curve.

.. [#DDProb] There are problems with :term:`Direct Democracy`. Members may collectively vote in 'the heat of the moment' or without giving due consideration to minority interests. However, the establishment of checks and balances such as 'constitutions', 'inviolable human rights', 'social charters', 'peer reviewed evidence' can be created as a component of the rules that members of the organisation agree to. These may be laid down in a manner similar to 'nomic' rules, with the 'constitution' being made up of 'immutable laws' which, if changes are required, will require elapsed time and a shift in status from 'immutable' to 'mutable' (and back) before changes take effect.
