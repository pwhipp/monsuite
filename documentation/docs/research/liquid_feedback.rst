Liquid Feedback
===============

`Liquid Feedback <http://liquidfeedback.org/>`_ is an open source application offering liquid democracy. It's what we're building here... or is it?

Maybe we can leverage and use it to begin with?

The back end is postgres with what looks to be a lua script supported front end using WebMCP.

Its not clear how this can easily be leveraged. Buying the book and spending some time (days) with the source might be the best next step.

The lack of an easily accessible online demo is very annoying.
