   GVote

   A distributed collection of files and folders that includes its entire history and manages changes to its content through changes to its content. Its a sorta git based vote moderated application. This can be a nomic like game, a club organization or a country's government.

We believe that government should respect everyone's right to freedom and self determination in so far as
it can be achieved without negating the equivalent rights in others.

We aim to carry out peaceful improvement to our government process that will
meet the following goals:

#. Deliver self govenment that respects individuals and maximizes their freedom.
#. Provide efficient stable democratic self government that respects minorities and individuals.
#. Eliminate the potential for political corruption.

We aim to deliver these improvements through the use and adoption of appropriate technology to support:

#. A collectively maintained body of law and manifesto
#. Effective use of experts and gathering of evidence in support of legal changes and improvements.
#. Issue based voting

Of course, to start this we'll start with a game/application that allows a user to create a distributed organization.
