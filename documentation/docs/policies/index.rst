Policies
========

Respect! policies are concerned with the underlying principles and process of government.
While these policies are aimed at achieving our goals and reflect the liberal principles that are necessitated by mutual respect, they are only suggestions and should be decided through an appropriate democratic process once it is in place.

Mind Dump
---------

One time, one world: Have just a single time (make it gmt). Use the times appropriately wherever.

Thus if a school wants daylight time for its kids, it can mutually agree the time with parents and transport - changing it once or twice per year if appropriate. Respect the people involved enough to let them decide upon their own time schedules - don't reset the clock for everyone!
