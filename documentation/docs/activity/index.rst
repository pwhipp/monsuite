Activity
========

This documentation will follow the same rules as it aims to define although I'm the only voter right now. These
activities are governed by the rules.

Proposed
--------

The following are proposed changes to this document. A proposal must be specific. When I decide the proposal is adequate and should be done, I move it to the to do list.

* Create rules using github/pull requests that start with the ability for any collaborator to make proposals
* add rules covering voting by collaborators to make updates to the document by promoting proposals -> to do etc.
* Research https://grpc.io/docs/guides/ as inter element interface
* Start adding thought experiments (glass of water)
* Add rules to this (its the same as any other collaboration)

To Do
-----

* Redo top level to describe the creation of a scalable tool that supports collaboration through an incorruptible distributed ledger and voting model that is self modifiable over time. Push the respect stuff down into a corner somewhere because using the tool for government is a long term aim. We can start with collaborating on a document (this document even), move to providing it as a better way to manage clubs and organizations and ultimately demonstrate its utility in peacefully upgrading existing governments.
