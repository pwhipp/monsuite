Hashgraph
==========

There is a big problem with scaling distributed ledger applications. `Hashigraph <https://hashgraph.com/>`_ claims to solve this.

Fundamentally, hashgraph appears to produce a consensual order of events. That is just what we want if we want a distributed consensual redux store type thing.

I'm unsure how the technology reasonably admits new nodes. It seems to be based upon the concept of a fixed initial set of notes.

The SDK and examples are all in Java which sucks for me because I will need to learn Java if I'm going to play with it.

If we assume that this technology will work we could start with a redux store model as our POT knowing that we can make it a distributed application if the rest of the stuff works.
