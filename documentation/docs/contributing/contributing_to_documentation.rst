Edit on Github
--------------

Select the "Edit on Github" option to be taken to the text file that is used to generate the documentation page you were just on. The file is presented in "preview" mode so should look very similar to the page you just left save that the headings and layout use GitHub's default presentation.

Click on the pencil icon to make your changes. Keep the formatting as simple as possible. If another page has the formatting you want, use its 'Edit on Github' option to see how to do it. Alternatively you can refer to the `cheat sheet`_ or google for what you need.
