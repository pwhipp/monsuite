Respect!
========

We believe that government should respect everyone's right to freedom and self determination in so far as
it can be achieved without negating the equivalent rights in others.

We aim to carry out peaceful improvement to our government process that will
meet the following goals:

#. Deliver self govenment that respects individuals and maximizes their freedom.
#. Provide efficient stable democratic self government that respects minorities and individuals.
#. Eliminate the potential for political corruption.
